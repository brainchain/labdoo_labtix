# CONFIGURATION REQUIRED!!! Please configure in PART0 the Images you have in your Hard Drive
###
# PART0: CONFIG PARAMETERS
# PART1: CHECK THAT OS is booted is in the same architecture as the system is, to avoid restoring in a wrong OS mode
# PART2: Check that the configured SOURCE path has some images on it
# PART3: Check the paramters of the system to see wich images we can use (Architecture and disk size)
# PART4: Ask the desired language of the IMAGE and propose and calculate images to install based on architecture and disksize 
# PART5: Ask Some additional questions (change hositid, skip shredding, what to do when finished)
# PART6: Since the deletion is going to start and give you some time, gather the parameters, in case you want to copy down
# PART7: Shreding
# PART8: RESTORE Redimension the partition table, check filesystem and call it a day
# PART9: If user selected, set the new hostid
# PART10: If user selected, shut down or suspend
